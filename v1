1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-mprtp] is an extension to RTP that allows multi
   homed endpoints to use a plurality of transmission paths to send/
   receive media.

   It involves splitting of a single RTP stream into multiple sub flows
   for transmission.  Each sub flow is a well formed RTP stream from the
   network perspective with it's own Subflow ID and Subflow-specific
   Sequence Number.  Sub flows might be active or passive depending on
   whether or not they actively participate in media transmission.
   Architecturally the MPRTP stack is a layer of a abstraction between
   the application that sends RTP packets and the plurality of paths for
   media transmission and is responsible for splitting and recombination
   of the RTP stream.  RTCP reports are exchanged per sub flow to
   account for variations in per path characteristics and are
   multiplexed on the same port as RTP.  The sub flow specific RTCP
   reports can be used by the MPRTP staack for path feedback , scheduling
   and load balancing.

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4347] is a channel
   security protocol that offers integrated key management, parameter
   negotiation, and secure data transfer.  Because DTLS data transfer
   protocol is generic, it is less highly optimized for use with RTP
   than is SRTP, which has been specifically tuned for that purpose ,
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] is an extension to DTLS that is optimized to work
   with Secure Real Time transport protocol [RFC3711] to provide
   integrated key management, SRTP algorithm negotiation and SRTP
   parameter negotiation.

   DTLS-SRTP is defined for point to point media sessions, wherein a
   DTLS association is setup between the two participants on the same
   ports used to exchange media.  Each DTLS-SRTP session contains a
   single DTLS association and either two SRTP contexts (if media

   traffic is flowing in both directions on the same host/port quartet)
   or one SRTP context (if media traffic is only flowing in one
   direction).  All SRTP traffic flowing over that pair in a given
   direction uses a single SRTP context.  When RTP and RTCP are
   multiplexed on the same port [RFC5761] the number of DTLS
   associations would reduce be two.

   When there are multiple media streams in a communication session, for
   example an endpoint that transmits both audio and video, the
   recommended approach as per [RFC5764] is to use "session resumption"
   to reduce public key operations.

2.  Motivation

   When MPRTP[I-D.ietf-avtcore-mprtp] is used along with DTLS-SRTP there
   will likely be multiple DTLS associations one for each 5-tuple.  This
   document describes how the DTLS association can be optimized.

3.  Using MPRTP with DTLS-SRTP

   As discussed above MPRTP uses multiple sub flows to enable
   transmission and receipt of media; the support for MPRTP by the
   sender is signaled by including the "a=mprtp" attribute in the offer
   , if the receiver is also MPRTP capable it includes the "a=mprtp"
   attribute in the answer.Advertisement of interfaces can either be
   done out-of-band (via SDP by explicitly listing the interfaces in the
   initial offer or using an updated offer) or in-band ( via RTCP
   extensions for MPRTP).

   Regardless of whether in-band or out-of-band is used , the initial
   offer/answer exchange contains the following in the SDP:

   1.  Support for MPRTP via the a=mprtp attribute.

   2.  The presence of the "fingerprint" and "setup" attributes as
       defined in [RFC4572] and [RFC4145] respectively.

3.1.  Setting up the Initial Subflow

   The offerer includes the list of available interfaces(assuming there
   is more than one interface available at session setup) ,the a=mprtp
   attribute , the "fingerprint" attribute which corresponds to the
   certificate that will be used during the DTLS handshake and the
   "setup" attribute which is set to "actpass".  The advertised
   interfaces are listed in decreasing order of priority and the host/
   port pair specified for the first priority interface will form the
   first half of the eventual host/port quartet that will be used to
   exchange SRTP packets bidirectionally.

   The answerer replies with the fingerprint attribute , a=mprtp
   attribute and the list of interfaces in decreasing order of priority
   , the first preference interface IP Address and port will form the
   host/port pair to setup the second half of the quartet used to
   exchange SRTP packets bi-directionally.  The server responds with an
   ACK, at this time there are 2 DLTS SRTP associations.  The salient
   aspects SDP negotiation are highlighted below.

3.2.  Adding Additional Subflows

   Once the initial subflow is setup , there are two DTLS associations
   that protect RTP and RTCP packets bidirectionally.  To protect
   additional subflows , instead of establishing a new DTLS
   association(complete with public key cryptography) , "session

   resumption" is used instead.  The creation of a new DTLS association
   ( either with complete public key cryptography or session resumption)
   leads to the creation of a new SRTP cryptographic context , however
   since MPRTP is essentially the splitting of an RTP stream over a
   plurality of subflows, co-ordination between the MPRTP, RTP, SRTP
   stacks is required to associate multiple 5 tuples to a single
   cryptographic context.

3.3.  Removing a Subflow

   During the course of the media session , interfaces may appear or
   disappear , in either case the endpoint must be capable of
   advertising the changes , either via SDP or RTCP.  When an interface
   and by extension a subflow is no longer available and this is
   communicated to the peer , the remaining subflows continue to utilize
   the existing SRTP cryptographic context.  The crypto context will
   continue to be referenced until the media session between the two
   peers is active regardless of addition or removal of subflows.

3.4.  Midcall Considerations

   During a media session between peers , interactions can change
   session characteristics , like codec for example.  If interactions
   cause a change in session participants , via a call transfer for
   example , existing cryptograhic contexts and DTLS associations must
   be purged and new ones established between the communicating peers as
   a result of a successful transfer.
